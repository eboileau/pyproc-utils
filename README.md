# Description

This repository contains various scripts, wrappers or snippets of Python3 code that are useful
for pre-/post-processing data associated with the `Rp-Bp` and/or `B-tea` pipelines, but that have not
been integrated into these projects. 

The reasons why these scripts are not yet part of either one of the pipelines could be that 
they are associated with recent data processing and/or visualisation or have a limited 
usage/application, or there are similar functionalities available, and they have not yet 
been superseded.

Besides, some of the repositories (pybio-utils in particular) could be restructured, and 
barely used code removed from the installation, or else e.g. installed in dev mode only.
