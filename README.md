# Description

This repository contains various scripts, wrappers or snippets of Python3 code that are useful
for pre-/post-processing data associated with the `Rp-Bp` and/or `B-tea` pipelines, but that have not
yet been integrated into these projects. This could be due to the fact that they are associated 
with recent (under development) data processing and/or visualisation or have a limited 
usage/application, or else that there are similar functionalities available, and they have not yet 
been superseded.

Before integrating any of these into either one of the pipelines, some *restructuration/cleaning* of the
repositories (incl. pybio-utils) appears necessary.
